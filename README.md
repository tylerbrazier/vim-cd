# vim-cd

`c<Tab>` to change to recent directories

The mapping starts `:Cd` which works like `:cd` but with completion that:

- shows directories in most recently used order
- filters matches anywhere in the name (not just the beginning)

I use this with [vim-forgit](https://github.com/tylerbrazier/vim-forgit)
to switch between projects fast.
